We're excited to announce that aiogram has a brand-new website designed to make your development
experience smoother and more productive.

This redesign focuses on improving accessibility to our most important resources while
adding new features to keep our community informed.

## What's New

### Enhanced GitHub Integration

Finding and accessing our GitHub repository is now easier than ever. We've added prominent links throughout the site, making it simple to:

- View the source code
- Report issues
- Submit pull requests
- Star the repository
- Track ongoing development

### Improved Documentation Visibility

We understand how critical good documentation is for developers. That's why we've:

- Reorganized our documentation with a clearer structure
- Added improved navigation
- Enhanced search functionality
- Made examples more prominent
- Included more comprehensive guides for beginners and advanced users

### New Blog Section

We're launching this very blog to provide:

- Framework updates and announcements
- Tutorials and best practices
- Case studies and success stories
- Community highlights
- Tips and tricks for Telegram bot development

## Why We Made These Changes

As aiogram continues to grow, we want to ensure that our resources grow alongside it.
These improvements are based directly on community feedback, with the goal of making aiogram more
accessible to developers at all skill levels.

The enhanced visibility of our documentation and GitHub repository means less time searching for
information and more time building amazing Telegram bots.

## What's Coming Next

This website redesign is just the first step in our ongoing commitment to improving the aiogram ecosystem.
In the coming months, we'll be:

- Publishing regular blog content with development insights
- Expanding our documentation with more real-world examples
- Creating more tutorials for common use cases
- Highlighting community projects

## Get Involved

We encourage everyone to explore the new website and all it has to offer.
If you have suggestions for further improvements or content you'd like to see on the blog,
please reach out through our GitHub issues or community channels.

Thank you for being part of the aiogram community!
